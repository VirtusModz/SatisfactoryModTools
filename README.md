## Creating A Mod

1. ### Create A Ue4 Project
* Use the same engine version your game uses (ex. Satisfactory uses 4.20(.3))
* Title the project the same way as the developers do it. You can find the name usually in the project directory (C:\Program Files\Epic Games\SatisfactoryEarlyAccess\FactoryGame (So Satisfactory's project name is FactoryGame)).

2. ### Make Your Mod
  * Add your map, Give it a Name, Add whatever you want, save it. When you are done package your mod for windows and put it under a random folder.
  
  3. ### Creating your .pak file
    * Open up the mod loader
    * If it asks for a location put the games main directory (C:\Program Files\Epic Games\SatisfactoryEarlyAccess\FactoryGame).
    * Give the mod a title.
    * Press Enter and wait at least 5 seconds.
